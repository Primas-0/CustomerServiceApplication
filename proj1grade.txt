I. Effort Grading

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
   produce output even after minor tweaks. Grading based on effort.
   Deductions from scripted grading and deductions marked below are
   ignored. Late penalties still apply.

   Choose one only:

   ~~  60:  Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project.
   ~~  45:  Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary.
   ~~  30:  Not much progress made. 
   ~~  15:  Barely started coding. 
   ~~   0:  Morally equivalent to no submission.

IV. Coding Standards

 X == -0:  Good indentation, comments, and choice of variable names

   == -2:  Poor or inconsistent indentation

   == -2:  Program uses global variables or static data members in lieu of 
           parameters and return values

   == -2:  In-line comments are terse and not meaningful
   == -3:  In-line comments are non-existent

   == -1:  Poor choice of variable names
   
           Comment: Good coding standard usage
